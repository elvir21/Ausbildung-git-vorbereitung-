## Forking a repo

### What is a fork?

You can fork a repository to create a copy of the repository and make changes without affecting the original project.

You can fork a repo when you

- want to propose changes but you do not have writing access for that project.
- want to use that repo as a basis for your own project.

### How to fork

1. fork via interface (if available)
2. clone
3. checking remotes (`git remote -v` verbose flag)
4. update origin (if forking via interface unavailable)
5. configure upstream repo (`git remote add upstream {url}`)
