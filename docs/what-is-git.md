# What is Git?

Git is the most commonly used version control system (VCS).
It is free and open sourced.
Git is a distributed VCS - everyone has the full history of the repository locally.

## What is Version Control?

A VCS tracks and manages changes to files in a repository.

- It keeps "snapshots" of every state the repository was in.
- It remembers who changed what, at what time, and why.
- It can compare different versions of the same repository.
- It provides the ability to "move back in time" and restore previous versions of the repository.
